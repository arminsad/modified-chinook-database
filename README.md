This repository contains a modified version of the `chinook` SQLite database at https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/.

`chinook.db` is the `chinook` SQLite database but with all of the columns renamed to match Laravel conventions.

`chinook-postgres.sql` is a SQL dump of the `chinook` database after I manually migrated it to Postgres from SQLite. For those taking ITP 405 with me, this is the file you will want.
